Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (or any other environment your project is using)
npm (or the package manager your project uses)
Git (if cloning from a Git repository)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
If you're working with a Git repository, start by cloning the project:

bash
Copy
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy
npm install
This will install all the necessary libraries and packages listed in package.json.

Step 3: Set Up the .env File
To securely manage sensitive environment variables (such as your database connection string and port number), we use a .env file.

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory.
Add the following entries in the .env file:
env
Copy
# Database connection string
DATABASE_URL="your_connection_string_here"

# Port for the application to run on
PORT=3000
