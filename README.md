# Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and configure your project using a `.env` file for your database connection string and port.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (or any other environment your project is using)
- **npm** (or the package manager your project uses)
- **Git** (if cloning from a Git repository)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you're working with a Git repository, start by cloning the project:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
